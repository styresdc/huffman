Youre as cold as ice
Youre willing to sacrifice our love
You never take advice
Someday youll pay the price I know
Ive seen it before
It happens all the time
Closing the door
You leave the world behind
Youre digging for gold
Yet throwing away
A fortune in feelings
But someday youll pay
Youre as cold as ice
Youre willing to sacrifice our love
You want paradise
But someday youll pay the price I know
